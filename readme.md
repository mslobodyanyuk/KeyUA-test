A task:
=======
PHP

There are several types of employees: programmer, designer, tester, manager.

1. Each employee is able to do his job in his own way:
- the programmer can: 1) write code, 2) test the code, 3) communicate with the manager
- the designer can: 4) draw, 3) communicate with the manager
- the tester can: 2) test the code, 3) communicate with the manager, 5) set tasks
- the manager can: 5) set tasks

2. In turn, they do not know how:
- programmer: 4) draw 5) set tasks
- designer: 1) write code 2) test code 5) set tasks
- tester: 1) write code 4) draw
- manager: 1) write code 4) draw 2) test code

the task:
- it is necessary to describe the ability of each employee using the principles of the PLO;
- write a console command using symfony (symfony console commands). AT
as a parameter, the team should take the name of the position. Result robots
teams must beat the list of employee skills. For writing logic, use services.
	startup example:
	
php bin/console company: employee programmer 

On framework Laravel:
        
        php artisan company:employee programmer
        		
the output should get like:

		- code writing
		- code testing
		- communication with manager
		
- also whether the employee can implement certain actions. Example for
implementation:
command: 

php bin/console employee: can programmer writeCode 

On framework Laravel:
        
        php artisan employee:can programmer writeCode        
        
	result:
		true

command: php bin/console employee: can programmer draw 
		
On framework Laravel:
        
        php artisan employee:can programmer draw
		
	result:
		false

MySQL

1. For a given list of products get the names of all categories in which are presented
products.

enters the specified categories.
	Selection for several categories (example: ids = (3, 4, 5)).

Note:
The database schema is created independently based on the above requirements. As a result
You must provide a database schema and SQL queries.

Actions on deployment of the project:
=====================================

1. `git clone << project path >>`

2. `—Åomposer install`

3. configure domain settings:

* ***on Ubuntu( Linux )***

_access to files in a folder_

`sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/LARAVEL/keyua_test.loc` 
	
_create new virtual host files_
	
`sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/test.loc.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/keyua_test.loc.conf`

_open a new file in the editor with root-rights_
	
`sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/keyua_test.loc.conf`
		
_configure on keyua_test.loc_  
```
Ctrl + O
Enter 
Ctrl + X
```
_enable new virtual hosts_	
	
`sudo a2ensite keyua_test.loc.conf`	
				
_after completion, you must restart Apache for the changes to take effect_

`sudo service apache2 restart`

_or_
				
`sudo systemctl restart apache2`

_edit hosts file_

`sudo nano /etc/hosts`
  
* ***on Windows***
 
`hosts` file, `httpd.conf`.


4. make a new database - keyua_test( utf8_general_ci encoding ) for example 

Or just download a database dump located in the /public folder
( - database dump contains CREATE/USE DATABASE statement):

`keyua_test.sql`


5. database settings in `.env` file:

```php
DB_DATABASE = keyua_test
DB_USERNAME = root
DB_PASSWORD = your_password
```

MySQL

- Database schema and SQL-queries.

Located in the /public folder in a file:

`Database schema and SQL-queries.txt`
